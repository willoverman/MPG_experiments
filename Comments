In congestion_games.py

Line 12: I think it should be self.m instead of self.n

Line 14: self.facilities, self.d (instead of d). (but this should make no difference, just to make it consistent with the use of self.d, self.n etc in lines 12,13).

Line 14: A more standard implementation of congestion games is with actions being subsets of the powerset of the facilities.
This routine (from stack exchange) does it (if we want to do it) 
###############
instead of 
  self.actions = list(it.combinations_with_replacement(self.facilities,d))
we can have
  self.actions = list(it.chain.from_iterable(it.combinations(self.facilities, r) for r in range(1,self.d+1)))
    
# you may change range(1,self.d+1) to range(len(self.facilities)+1) or anything else.
################
Note also that (after a quick check) actions of different size are not a problem for the other subroutines (e.g., get_counts) that we have.
